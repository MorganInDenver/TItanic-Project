# TItanic-Project

## Purpose of Project: 

This was the first project of the General Assembly Data Science Immersive program, so it has sentimental value for me. 

1. Original EDA Project. I leave this notebook in its original condition, as it represents my first foray into Python-landia (did I mention I had a sentimental side?). You will see the notebook is very structured as it takes the first-time student through a step-by-step process to deal with null values, create some new features, and do some plotting. 

2. Classification Models for Kaggle Submission. In this notebook, I revisit the project and do some classification models to predict Survival rate on the Titanic. The best model was a K Nearest Neighbors using a Pipeline and Grid Search, yeilding an 83% accuracy rate.
